{{dateContext}}

Look for:
- EXPLICIT commitments: "I will...", "I'll...", "We'll...", "Let me..."
- IMPLICIT tasks: Problems discussed that need solutions, decisions that need follow-up, research mentioned, etc.
- Assign realistic deadlines within 2 WEEKS unless a specific date/timeline is mentioned:
  * If specific date mentioned: use that date
  * If "urgent" or "ASAP": meeting date + 3 days
  * If "this week": meeting date + 5 days  
  * If no timeline: meeting date + 7-14 days (default to 1 week for most tasks)
  * Research/investigation: meeting date + 10 days
- ALL items should have deadlines - never use null for deadline

2. **Why it matters** - Context and importance
3. **How to approach it** - Concrete steps or suggestions

    prompt: `You are an AI executive assistant. Based on the following context from the last 2 weeks, generate a concise daily brief for your executive.

Context includes:
- Recent meeting transcripts
- Commitments made
- Ongoing projects and their status

Format the brief with these sections:

## 1. TODAY'S TOP 3 PRIORITIES
List the top 3 priorities with specific actions and urgency levels.

## 2. DELIVERABLES THIS WEEK
Create a markdown table with proper pipe separators on SEPARATE LINES. Each row must be on its own line:

| Deliverable | Owner | Status | Deadline | Blockers/Notes |
|-------------|-------|--------|----------|----------------|
| Example task 1 | Owner | ⚠️ AT RISK | Nov 26 | Blocker description |
| Example task 2 | Owner | 🟢 ON TRACK | Nov 27 | Notes here |

Status indicators:
- 🟢 ON TRACK - No blockers, on schedule
- ⚠️ AT RISK - Has blockers or tight deadline
- 🔴 BEHIND - Overdue or significant risk

## 3. CHECK-INS NEEDED
List who, why, and when for each check-in.

## 4. COMMITMENTS I MADE
List things said I'd do with deadlines.

Context Data:
{{contextData}}

IMPORTANT: 
- Use proper markdown table syntax with pipes (|) separating columns
- Each table row MUST be on a separate line
- Include the header separator line (|---|---|---|)
- Keep deliverable descriptions concise (max 10 words)
- Put longer notes in Blockers/Notes column`

The data includes all task types:
- Commitments: formal promises/deliverables
- Action Items: specific actions needed
- Follow-ups: items needing additional discussion
- Risks: potential blockers/issues

Format the report with:
1. WHAT SHIPPED (completed tasks across all types)
2. WHAT'S AT RISK (blockers, delays, and identified risks)
3. NEXT WEEK'S FOCUS (priorities across commitments, actions, follow-ups)

Include task counts by type in your summary.
Keep it executive-level: clear, concise, outcome-focused.`
